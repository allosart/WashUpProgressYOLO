# WashUpProgressYOLO

Test notebook based on: [notebooks/230-yolov8-optimization/230-yolov8-optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/230-yolov8-optimization/230-yolov8-optimization.ipynb)

# Idea

Show the wash up progress when cleaning kitchen intems in the sink.
Detect the sink and its bounding box. Count the kitchen items that have the bounding box inside the sink box and outside of it.
Print how many items are detected inside and outside the sink, and show the percentage of progress for the wash up (cleaned items vs total)
